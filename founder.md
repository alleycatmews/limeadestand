Maybe I'm a permanent traveler. As early as I could remember in my life, I felt like I was in a wrong planet. I was the ultimate outsider looking in, a stranger in a strange land. As I grew up, I was simultaneously the brightest kid in class and the bullies' favorite sandbag.  My parents did everything they could to raise me as a gifted child, although they never quite understood my weirdness and I caused them much frustration and grief.  

I was a keen explorer of the world. I devoured knowledge. I loved to learn about different languages, cultures, faiths, traditions, and customs. It fascinated me to understand why and how people believe, think and act the way they did (and still do). In my early childhood, media and information industries intrigued me. I wanted to start a newspaper, a magazine, or a radio station.  Along the road I naturally acquired journalistic skills and geek skills.  When I was in high school I set up an undercover low-power FM radio station in my church that would live-cast the Sunday sermons over the air. Twenty years ago I was in college studying journalism and worked as an editor for a small weekly paper in a neighborhood. I also made my very first website 20 years ago in December 1995, having self-taught HTML 3.2 and hand-coding HTML pages in a VT-100 "dumb" terminal that I could use for free at an Internet cafe.  

I founded Limeade Stand in 2015 after spending a good part of this decade working in social activism.  During my life as a community organizer, I have seen limits of political activism and needs for immediate solutions to counter poverty, and more importantly, to lift people's spirit in the face of a seemingly adverse world. I realized that each person needs to take ownership and pride in their own lives, and while they possess unique talents and innate capacities for freedom, they are prevented from achieving because of limiting beliefs as well as social inequities. In 2010, I co-founded a community organization called Jaguar Sisters, and initiated a project to support homeless women to launch their own microbusiness as ways to create income streams, and to free themselves from predatory and explotative "boyfriends" and/or survival prostitution.  

In most of my life, I lived outside the box and outside the system. DIY, Maker Culture and Lifehacks are all in my blood. I have lived both in an affluence of the upper middle class (thanks dad!) and in extreme poverty. I have learned ways to survive and not letting poverty destroy my spirit. Even in the midst of prolonged homelessness (I have survived several below-freezing winters outside), I managed to write and self-publish a book on frugal living (and another book on how to write a press release or a newspaper article, and taught several classes on that topic), ran a weekly free community events newsletter, and even booked speaking engagements to talk about becoming resourceful.  

Limeade Stand is a combination of personalized services and educational resources to help you build your own freedom with your own hands.  In particular, I teach and facilitate people to start their own _hyper-microenterprises_ with little to no capital requirement, and build their business from zero in a realistic and sustainable manner. Additionally, from years of my experiences as a grassroots community organizers and non-profit board member, I also help individuals and groups start their own community organizations, manage volunteer-driven projects, and plan events.
