### I don't have any money right now

I hear you. I know how it is to be in your shoes. Every dollar and cent is precious and could mean a difference between having something to eat today or be hungry. I don't want you to gamble your dinner for a wishful thinking. 

Starting a business Limeade Stand way is a discipline and a commitment, and yet, it is one of the most creative things you will do in life. Limeade Stand way means you tap deeply into your existing resources and strengths. I believe with all my heart that every person -- that's you and me -- possesses the very same creative spirit that brought this very universe into existence. In the Bible we read that the Creator made us in the very likeness, the very image, of the Divine, only slightly less than __Elohim__ (many English translations say "angels" but in Hebrew that word means God!). So by extension, the most logical conclusion is that the Divine Will for your life is to reach your fullest potentials -- which has always been part of who you are.

As a social entrepreneur, I'd like to see more individuals like you to take your freedom back into your own hands -- not in the hands of some government or charity industry bureaucrats, not in the hands of abusive spouses or partners, and not certainly in the hands of exploitative big corporate employers.  

Here in this section of the Limeade Stand website it's all about free stuff.  Some of the resources are original and exclusive here, from me; while other resources are from various organizations that I highly recommend. Information here includes both starting up your own business from zero, as well as how to survive in the meanwhile.

### _Mile Zero: Your first step when you can't afford anything_ 

Not every journey starts from zero, but every road has its Mile Zero post. This short and easy e-book is like an emergency toolbox you can use right away to start your own hyper-micro-business, albeit very small, even if you have little to no money to your own name. Packed with practical information, this book reflects the author's lived experiences, exceptional ability to curate information, and incredible resourcefulness. This should be the first step for everyone who is curious about what Limeade Stand has to offer, whether or not you might later choose to work with me.  

_Mile Zero_ is available to everyone for the [asking](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01KDZkbysHbHPngBUPbQFC3w==&c=sW9O4sP0zcY70YkyB8tEVpHKzL8eTTlDrib09U-N89A=), or by [subscribing to the _Limeade Stand News_ email list](http://eepurl.com/bDf5CH).

### Free resources galore  

_Many of these resources are specific to Portland, Oregon metropolitan area._

* [Code Oregon](http://codeoregon.org) - Offered through local business Treehouse from its Boise-Eliot neighborhood office, and funded by the State of Oregon, this online educational program is free to all Oregon residents for up to one year. While most of the courses focus on computer technology (how to build websites, how to write computer programs, how to blog with Wordpress, etc.) there are also classes on graphic designs and entrepreneurship.  

* Your neighborhood library. Most public libraries have decent books on entrepreneurship and small business management. Look for "658" call numbers (may or may not have decimals after "658"). Multnomah County Library has [a very helpful webpage](http://multcolib.org/business) set up for this topic, as well as free access to various [digital resources](https://multcolib.org/resource/small-business-resource-center) (MCL library card required - free for Clackamas, Hood River, Multnomah, Washington county residents as well as those who live within the boundaries of the Fort Vancouver Regional Library District in Washington State).  

* Community colleges. Clackamas Community College-Harmony Campus and Portland Community College-CLIMB Center have [Small Business Development Centers](http://bizcenter.org/), and many of their services are free.  

* [You've got to eat](assets/pdf/pdx-survival.pdf). I have compiled a list for you.
