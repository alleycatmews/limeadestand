For many kids, starting their own lemonade stand is a rite of passage. Not only that they learn valuable social skills, they also learn the concept of freedom: taking affirmative actions to craft their own paths to reach their objectives. How many of you have had some outrageous dreams as a small child about what you wanted to be when you grow up, only to find yourself stuck in the rut? There is a proverb in Asia: "the soul of a three-year-old remains until a hundred"; and there was a bestseller book in the 1990s, titled: _All I really needed to know, I learned in kindergarten_.  

**Limeade Stand** is a combination of personalized services and educational resources to help you build your own freedom with your own hands.  In particular, I teach and facilitate people to start their own _hyper-microenterprises_ with little to no capital requirement, and build their business from zero in a realistic and sustainable manner. Additionally, from years of my experiences as a grassroots community organizers and non-profit board member, I also help individuals and groups start their own community organizations, manage volunteer-driven projects, and plan events.  

Here at **Limeade Stand** we believe that each person is endowed with innate creativity and inner resources. We are a social enterprise dedicated to spreading the knowledge that liberates people, to build their own freedom with their own hands. Our unique focus is on the population that is largely neglected and underserved by conventional businesses.  

The **social mission** of **Limeade Stand** is simple: To facilitate the process of self-empowerment through helping ordinary individuals launch their own **hyper-microenterprises** and **grass-roots community organizations**. Harnessing the strengths of today's emergent knowledge economy and deeply rooted in the contemporary DIY/Maker culture, Limeade Stand solves the several major barriers to entry and participation to market by a large number of people today: access to working start-up capital and credit, lack of social capital, and lack of vital knowledge and skills. Unlike others, we are willing to work with our clients at wherever they are - and hyper-microenterprise ventures could encompass both formal and informal sectors.  

## Limeade Stand is a ready resource for your independent entrepreneurial aspirations, even if you lack any financial resource.  

* Initial pre-launch and start-up consultation and education  
* Research assistance

* Educational resources, including upcoming books _Cleo's limeade stand_ (for children) and _Yes, you too can start your own business (even if you're homeless)_ (for adults), and companion online contents.  

## Information is not knowledge  

Today people are inundated with unending flow of information. There are many useless advices and outright harmful information (scams) on the Internet.  Some people have not acquired sufficient media literacy to understand what is true, and to distinguish useful information from garbage. Furthermore, most people simply do not have time to make an in-depth inquiry. Finding knowledge is like traveling, and safe traveling requires street-smart.  Here at Limeade Stand, I find out, fact check, compare and evaluate, and then curate information you need so you can make a fully informed decision.  

## Learn more  

This website is being just set up (Full disclosure: I am learning how to build a website using [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) instead of manually writing HTML5 and CSS, so there will be some frustrating bugs along the road. Please let me know if you find any issues.) and there will be more contents soon.
