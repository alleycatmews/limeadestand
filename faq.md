### Is this a non-profit organization?  

No. This is a for-profit enterprise, and is supported solely by revenues generated from business activities, including fees and tuitions.  

### Are you exploiting the poor, then?  

While some may falsely think that I am trying to make profits off those who could afford any money the least, please consider these:  

* This is real work, which requires both my time and labor. I do the work that my clients either do not know how, or would take much longer for them to learn and do.  You should agree that all workers deserve fair compensation, not?  
* My pricing model is graduated in such a way that initial expenses on my clients are set low.  
* I have seen, over years, so many non-profit social service agencies that purport to help the people squander donor money and government funds to pay for real estate and executive salaries, while using the poor as convenient publicity props to extract more money from well-intentioned donors. As a small independent micro-business I receive no government or foundation money. My business grows and sustains itself just like any of my clients', using the exact same model that I teach them.  Which is more ethical?  

### Do you provide capital for startup?  

No. This is neither a bank nor a foundation.  However, I teach "bakery model," a completely self-financing business model that lets people start right away from zero and gradually build their own capital as they grow sustainably. The major advantages to this model is that everyone can do it regardless of their credit history or access to banking services, and perhaps more importantly, they would not incur debts.

### What do you mean by hyper-microenterprise?  

Hyper-microenterprises are small independent businesses, usually under a sole proprietorship, that is intended to support the basic livelihood of their owners and immediate family members. For the purpose of Limeade Stand's programs, this is a business enterprise that requires little to no overhead and initial capital requirement, with annual gross revenue of under $25,000 USD.  Most hyper-microenterprises are either highly mobile or home-based, and Limeade Stand works with both formal and informal sectors.   

### Why help the poor start businesses? Why not help them get a job?  

In years of working within the homeless community I discovered that not everyone can just go out and get a job.  Many low-income people have various forms of disabilities, mental illnesses, or due to [past criminal records](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3051526/instead-of-job-training-this-startup-helps-former-inmates-start-their-own-businesses) (or lack of past job history), they cannot easily fit into the mainstream corporate ecosystem called "jobs."  Microenterprise has been a proven way to counter poverty in many third-world countries and there are international foundations and NGOs that actively fund and support such businesses (examples include the [Grameen Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank), [World Vision](http://donate.worldvision.org/ways-to-give/by-category/micro-loans), and [Mercy Corps](http://www.mercycorps.org/tags/microfinance)). It begs a question why they are not doing the same in the U.S. -- maybe because they falsely believe that the American poor are somehow less capable than those in South Africa or Bangladesh who are far, far worse off than the poorest of the poor in America?  I think that's insulting and I'm here to challenge that assumption!

## Who are you helping? 

Much of the support I give is personalized and one-on-one, so my programs are primarily geared towards residents of the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area, Columbia County, Oregon, and Clark County, Washington.  However, some of the resources, products and services will be available online for anybody in the world.  Please keep in mind, however, that economic situations, laws and regulations, and market conditions vary vastly from one place to another. Information provided through Limeade Stand is mostly based on what works in Oregon.  

## What do you mean by a "social enterprise"?  

Social enterprise is a business with a community-oriented mission and deep sense of social responsibilities.  While this is a for-profit business and making profits is one of the important reasons for its existence, everything I do is linked to the [social mission](about.html) of Limeade Stand.  

## Why Limeade Stand, not lemonade?  

I like limeade better. Let's be different! There's nothing wrong with being a rebel.  Be countercultural.  Stand above the competitors in the sea of lemonade stands!  

Also: I am writing a story book for children, titled _Cleo's Limeade Stand_.  [Cleo](https://twitter.com/qleopurr) is a white cat that wants to see a squirrel that loves cats, that ostensibly dwells in the "end of the world." Cleo learns all about entrepreneurship and starts her own limeade stand so she could save up money to go to the end of the world.
