> Not every journey starts from zero, but every road has its Mile Zero post.  

Here at Limeade Stand, I work even with people who might not have any money at all at the moment. I meet with people wherever they may be, and this distinguishes Limeade Stand from other small business consulting and training firms. 

One of the greatest barriers to overcoming poverty is lack of access to credit and/or capital, yet with ingenuity and resourcefulness it is possible to hack away these barriers.  

I am pleased to announce the release of my newest publication, _Mile Zero: Your first step when you can't afford anything_. This short and easy e-book is like an emergency toolbox you can use right away to start your own hyper-micro-business, albeit very small, even if you have little to no money to your own name. Packed with practical information, this book reflects the author's lived experiences, exceptional ability to curate information, and incredible resourcefulness. This should be the first step for everyone who is curious about what Limeade Stand has to offer, whether or not you might later choose to work with me. And best of all, this is free to everyone for the asking!  

Topics include:  

* The greatest battlefield is in your mind: having a right mindset when you're broke  
* You are the capital and the asset: how to tap into your inner resources  
* Starting up from the Mile Zero post: entrepreneurship from $0.00  
* Technology is your friend  
* What's social capital?  
* Income events versus business  
* and more  

and it's free.
